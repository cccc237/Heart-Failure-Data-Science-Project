# Heart-Failure-Data-Science-Project
Data science project to predict potential heart failure.

**Problem Statement**
Cardiovascular diseases such as heart failures, heart muscle disease, heart valve disease, etc. are the leading cause of death globally. The most commom symptoms for cardiovascular diseases include chest pain, numb legs and/or arms, lightheaded, and swollen limbs. It is important to be able to predict a potential heart disease based on some data of the human body. With this dataset, it contains features that can help us to create machine learning model in predicting cardiovascular diseases.
